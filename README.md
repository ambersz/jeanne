Goal:

- A state representation and action framework to back flexible version control systems.
  - Fully associative and commutative
  - Can represent a range of conflict states
    - Conflicts due to lack of sufficient context
    - Contradictory context information ("A is before B" AND "B is before A")
- A mapping from the state representation to an informative textual representation
